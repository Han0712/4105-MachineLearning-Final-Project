# 4105-Final-Project
In this project me and my teammates created a moving rating guesser based that is trained on dataset published by IMDb 
We used classes such as genera, budget, country of orgin, etc... to train and see what a movie's rating will be based on these parameters
"Final Project.ipynb" contains the data analysis part of the project
"Fina_Project.ipynb" contains both data analysis and machine learning
